# Remove hardcoded paths and improve project portability

## Summary
Remove all hardcoded user-specific paths (JefferyCaldwell) and make the project portable across different environments. Also adds security improvements.

## Changes

### 🔒 Security Improvements
- Removed `claude_desktop_config.json` with hardcoded paths
- Added `claude_desktop_config.json` to `.gitignore`
- Created `claude_desktop_config.example.json` as a template

### 🔧 Portability Fixes
Fixed hardcoded paths in all startup and build scripts:
- `setup-mcp.js` - Now uses `path.resolve(__dirname)`
- `start-engine.js` - Uses relative paths
- `start-mcp.js` - Uses relative paths  
- `start-all.js` - Uses relative paths
- `build-phase1.js` - Uses relative paths
- `package.json` - Generic repository URL
- `mcp-inspector/mcp-inspector.js` - Uses ES module path resolution

### 📝 Path Changes
All instances of `C:\Users\JefferyCaldwell\myMCP` replaced with:
- `path.resolve(__dirname)` for base directory
- `path.join(__dirname, 'packages', ...)` for subdirectories

## Impact
- Project now works on any system regardless of username or OS
- No security credentials exposed in version control
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Claude Desktop config must be generated per-user

## Testing
- ✅ Engine starts successfully with new paths
- ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ All build scripts use relative paths
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in repository
