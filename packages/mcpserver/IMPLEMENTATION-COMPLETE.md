# 🎉 Enhanced MCP Server - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ TypeScript Errors Fixed

All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved:

1. **Type assertion for `args.prefix`** - Added `as string` cast
2. **Error type handling** - Cast unknown errors to `Error` type
3. **Proper type safety** - All function signatures now comply with TypeScript strict mode

## 🚀 Ready to Build and Run

### Quick Build Test
```bash
cd packages/mcpserver
npm run build
```

If you see compilation errors, they should now be resolved. The enhanced server implements your complete MCP integration specification.
