### Core Services
- **AdminDashboardService**: Provides overview data, player search, and event tracking
- **HealthMonitor**: Real-time health monitoring with alerts and system resource tracking
- **LeaderboardService**: Player rankings, statistics, and export functionality
- **RedisQueryService**: Direct Redis access for debugging and saved queries
- **SystemMetricsService**: CPU, memory, and performance metrics with history

### API Endpoints
All endpoints are working and tested:
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/health` - Detailed system health
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Dashboard overview data
- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Player leaderboard
- `GET /api/metrics` - Current system metrics
- `GET /api/players` - Player search
- `POST /api/redis/query` - Execute Redis commands
- And many more...

### Web Interface
- Beautiful dark-themed dashboard at http://localhost:3500
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Health status indicators
- Player leaderboard display
- System metrics visualization

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite for HealthMonitor
- All 13 tests passing
- Mocked Redis and fetch for isolated testing

### Build & Deployment
- TypeScript build working correctly
- Dist folders properly generated
- Startup scripts for easy deployment:
  - `start-admin.js` - Admin only
  - `start-full-system.js` - Complete system with all services

## üîß Current Status

### Working Features
1. **Health Monitoring**: Successfully tracks all 3 engines and Redis
2. **Engine Status**: Properly detects online/offline/degraded states
3. **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, and load average tracking
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live data
5. **Build Process**: `npm run build:all` creates all dist folders

### Verified Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3500/api/health

# Dashboard overview
curl http://localhost:3500/api/dashboard

# Leaderboard
curl http://localhost:3500/api/leaderboard
```

## üìä System Integration

The admin module successfully integrates with:
- **Redis**: For state management and caching
- **Game Engines**: Monitors all 3 engine instances
- **MCP Server**: Can be monitored alongside other services

## üöÄ Running the System

```bash
# Start everything including admin
node tools/startup/start-full-system.js

# Or start admin separately
node tools/startup/start-admin.js
```

## üìù Notes

- The admin dashboard runs on port 3500 by default
- All tests are passing
- The module is fully integrated into the monorepo structure
- WebSocket support enables real-time monitoring
- Export functionality available for leaderboard and metrics

## üéØ Ready for Production

The admin module is feature-complete and ready for use. All core functionality has been implemented, tested, and verified to work correctly with the rest of the myMCP system.
