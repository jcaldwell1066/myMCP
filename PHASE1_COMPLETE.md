# Phase 1 MCP Integration - Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Phase 1 Complete: MCP Server Wrapper

We've successfully implemented Phase 1 of the MCP integration, which provides a JSON-RPC wrapper around the existing myMCP Engine REST API.

### What's Been Built

#### âœ… MCP Server (`packages/mcpserver`)
- **Resources**: 7 different game state resources accessible via MCP URIs
- **Tools**: 9 action tools for quest management, player updates, and chat
- **JSON-RPC Protocol**: Full MCP compatibility for Claude Desktop

#### âœ… Engine Improvements (`packages/engine`)
- **Enhanced Validation**: Joi schemas for player updates and actions
- **Better Error Handling**: Specific error messages for missing quests/steps
- **MCP-Friendly Endpoints**: Player lists, quest catalog, and server stats
- **Improved API Responses**: More detailed success/error messages

### Quick Start

1. **Build Everything**:
   ```bash
   node build-phase1.js
   ```

2. **Start the Engine**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/engine
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test MCP Server** (in new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd packages/mcpserver
   npm start
   ```

### MCP Resources Available

| Resource URI | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `mcp://game/player/mcp-player` | Player profile and stats |
| `mcp://game/quests/mcp-player` | Available/active/completed quests |
| `mcp://game/state/mcp-player` | Complete game state |
| `mcp://game/inventory/mcp-player` | Player inventory |
| `mcp://game/chat-history/mcp-player` | Conversation history |
| `mcp://system/health` | Engine health status |
| `mcp://system/llm-status` | LLM provider status |

### MCP Tools Available

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `start_quest` | Start a quest for the player |
| `complete_quest_step` | Complete a step in active quest |
| `complete_quest` | Complete the current quest |
| `update_player` | Update player properties |
| `set_player_score` | Set player score |
| `change_location` | Change player location |
| `send_chat_message` | Send chat message and get AI response |
| `get_completions` | Get tab completion suggestions |
| `use_item` | Use an item from inventory |

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myMCP": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/Users/JefferyCaldwell/myMCP/packages/mcpserver/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ENGINE_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "DEFAULT_PLAYER_ID": "claude-player"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Engine Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Validation**: All player updates and actions now have proper Joi validation
2. **Better Error Messages**: Specific errors for missing quests, steps, and invalid operations
3. **New MCP-Friendly Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/players` - List all active players
   - `GET /api/quest-catalog` - Get quest definitions
   - `GET /api/stats` - Server and game statistics
4. **Improved Response Format**: Success messages and better error context

### Testing the Integration

Once both services are running, you can test the MCP integration:

1. **Engine Health**: Visit `http://localhost:3000/health`
2. **MCP Server**: Should show connection messages when started
3. **Claude Desktop**: Should list myMCP as an available server

### Next Phase Ideas

- **Phase 2**: Enhanced MCP-specific resources and intelligent prompts
- **Phase 3**: Real-time streaming capabilities  
- **Phase 4**: Advanced context-awareness and AI-driven gameplay

The foundation is now solid for full MCP integration! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
