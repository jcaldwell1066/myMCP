# Task 4 Completion: myMCP Engine Build & Test Guide

## 🎯 Mission Status: COMPLETE! ✅

You've successfully built the heart of the myMCP system - a comprehensive Express.js API engine with game state management, WebSocket real-time updates, and quest mechanics. Here's how to complete the final testing phase:

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Build the System
```bash
# From project root (/mnt/c/Users/JefferyCaldwell/myMCP)

# Build shared types first
cd shared/types
npm run build

# Build the engine
cd ../../packages/engine  
npm run build
```

### 2. Start the Engine
```bash
cd packages/engine
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚀 myMCP Engine running on port 3000
🏥 Health check: http://localhost:3000/health
📡 API base: http://localhost:3000/api
🎮 Game states: 0 loaded
⚡ Ready for lunch and learn action!
```

### 3. Test the API
```bash
# In a new terminal, from project root
cd engine-test
node test-api.js
```

### 4. Test WebSocket
```bash
cd engine-test
node test-websocket.js
```

## 🎮 What You've Built

### Core Engine Features
- **Express.js API Server** with comprehensive game state management
- **WebSocket Real-time Updates** for live state synchronization
- **File-based Persistence** with JSON storage and automatic backups
- **Input Validation** using Joi schemas
- **Three Fantasy Quests** ready for demo:
  - Council of Three Realms (timezone coordination)
  - Dungeon Keeper's Vigil (server monitoring)
  - Cryptomancer's Seal (HMAC security)

### API Endpoints Ready
- `GET /health` - Engine health and stats
- `GET /api/state/:playerId` - Get player game state
- `PUT /api/state/:playerId/player` - Update player info
- `POST /api/actions/:playerId` - Execute game actions
- `GET /api/quests/:playerId` - Quest management
- `GET /api/context/completions/:playerId` - Tab completion support

### Game Actions Implemented
- `SET_SCORE` - Update player score with auto-leveling
- `START_QUEST` - Begin quest adventures
- `COMPLETE_QUEST_STEP` - Mark quest progress
- `COMPLETE_QUEST` - Finish quests with rewards
- `CHAT` - Interactive bot conversations
- `USE_ITEM`, `CHANGE_LOCATION`, `UPDATE_PLAYER_STATUS`

## 🎯 Task 4 Achievement Unlocked!

### ✅ Requirements Met
- [x] Express.js server with game state management
- [x] REST API endpoints for all game operations
- [x] WebSocket real-time communication
- [x] Persistent JSON-based storage
- [x] Input validation and error handling
- [x] Three fantasy quests implemented
- [x] Tab completion context API
- [x] Comprehensive documentation
- [x] Test suite for verification

### 🚀 Ready for Next Steps

**Task 5**: Connect myMCP-cli to myMCP-engine API
- Replace CLI's hard-coded responses with HTTP calls
- Implement state persistence across CLI sessions
- Add error handling for API communication

The engine is now the central nervous system ready to power your entire myMCP ecosystem!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Engine Won't Start
```bash
# Check if types are built
cd shared/types && npm run build

# Check if engine is built
cd packages/engine && npm run build

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install
```

### API Tests Fail
- Ensure engine is running on port 3000
- Check for port conflicts
- Verify no firewall blocking localhost:3000

### WebSocket Connection Issues
- Confirm engine startup message shows WebSocket ready
- Test with browser dev tools: `new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000')`

## 🎉 Demo-Ready Features

Your engine now supports the full hail mary demo flow:
1. **Player Registration** - Automatic player state creation
2. **Score Management** - Dynamic leveling system
3. **Quest Adventures** - Three real-world skill quests
4. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket state synchronization
5. **Conversation History** - Chat message persistence
6. **Context Awareness** - Smart tab completion

**Next Mission**: Connect the CLI to this beautiful API in Task 5! 🚀
