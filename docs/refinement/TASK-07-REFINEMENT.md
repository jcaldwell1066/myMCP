# Task 7 Refinement: LLM API Integration for Dynamic Narrative

## Change Statement
Integrate Large Language Model (LLM) API into myMCP-engine to replace hard-coded bot responses with dynamic, context-aware narrative generation. Implementation includes adding a NarrativeService class, new API endpoints (`/api/narrative/generate` and `/api/narrative/action-response`), LLM client integration (OpenAI/Anthropic), and prompt engineering for game state awareness. The system will generate varied responses based on player location, inventory, quest progress, and conversation history with caching to manage API costs.

## Testability Statement
Highly testable with layered validation approach: (1) Unit tests for NarrativeService with mocked LLM responses to verify prompt building and state handling, (2) Integration tests for API endpoints using supertest with mock services, (3) E2E tests with actual LLM API calls to validate response quality and context accuracy, (4) Performance tests for caching effectiveness and response times. Manual testing required for narrative quality assessment and context appropriateness across different game scenarios.

## Build/Config Concerns
**Medium Risk**: Requires new dependencies (OpenAI SDK, dotenv), environment variable management for API keys, and potential cost monitoring. Main risks: (1) API key security and rotation strategy, (2) LLM API rate limits and cost control mechanisms, (3) Network dependency for external LLM service, (4) Response time variability affecting user experience. Requires fallback system for API failures and caching strategy for cost optimization.

## Complexity Score: 7/10
**Medium-High Complexity** - Involves external API integration with financial implications, sophisticated prompt engineering, and state-aware response generation. Complexity stems from managing LLM API variability, implementing effective caching, ensuring consistent narrative quality, and handling edge cases (API failures, inappropriate responses). Requires careful prompt design and response validation mechanisms.
