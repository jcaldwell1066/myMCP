# Task 11 Refinement: HMAC Security (Cryptomancer's Seal)

## Change Statement
Create an educational cryptography quest disguising HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) implementation as fantasy spell-crafting mechanics. The system teaches hash functions, message integrity, and authentication through interactive "seal creation" where players craft cryptographic seals, verify message authenticity, and learn about security concepts. Implementation includes CryptomancerService for HMAC operations, interactive CLI spell-casting commands, step-by-step tutorials on cryptographic concepts, and integration with fantasy narrative explaining security principles through magical metaphors.

## Testability Statement
Cryptography-focused testing strategy: (1) Unit tests for HMAC implementation accuracy against known test vectors, (2) Security testing for proper key handling and algorithm implementation, (3) Educational testing to verify cryptographic concepts are correctly explained, (4) CLI testing for spell-casting interface usability, (5) Integration tests for quest progression and reward systems. Manual testing required for educational effectiveness and ensuring cryptographic accuracy in fantasy explanations.

## Build/Config Concerns
**Low-Medium Risk**: Requires crypto library dependencies (Node.js crypto module), secure key generation/storage mechanisms, and educational content validation. Main risks: (1) Cryptographic implementation correctness and security, (2) Secure key management and storage practices, (3) Educational content accuracy for security concepts, (4) Performance considerations for cryptographic operations. Minimal infrastructure changes but requires security audit for crypto implementation.

## Complexity Score: 6/10
**Medium Complexity** - Well-defined cryptographic scope with established algorithms and clear educational objectives. Complexity stems from ensuring cryptographic accuracy, creating effective educational metaphors, and maintaining security best practices. The challenge lies in making complex mathematical concepts accessible through fantasy storytelling while preserving technical accuracy and security principles.
