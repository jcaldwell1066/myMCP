# Task 9 Refinement: Global Meeting Quest (Council of Three Realms)

## Change Statement
Implement the first practical quest combining real-world timezone coordination with fantasy narrative, creating a "Council of Three Realms" meeting scheduler. The system includes TimeRealmsService for timezone conversion mechanics, CouncilMembersService for team discovery with fantasy character generation, CouncilMeetingsService for scheduling logic with voting, and calendar integration for .ics file generation. CLI commands provide fantasy-themed interfaces for registration, scheduling, and voting, while maintaining practical calendar functionality for real team coordination.

## Testability Statement
Comprehensive testing strategy: (1) Unit tests for timezone conversion accuracy, character generation algorithms, and meeting scheduling logic, (2) Integration tests for API endpoints covering member registration, meeting creation, and voting workflows, (3) CLI command testing with mocked inquirer responses and API calls, (4) E2E testing of complete quest flow from registration through calendar generation. Manual testing required for fantasy narrative quality, ASCII art display, and real-world calendar integration functionality.

## Build/Config Concerns
**Medium Risk**: Requires new dependencies (ics library, timezone data), database schema for members/meetings, and potential calendar service integrations. Main risks: (1) Timezone data accuracy and daylight saving time handling, (2) Database performance with meeting voting operations, (3) Calendar file generation compatibility across platforms, (4) LLM API usage for narrative generation costs. Requires careful timezone library selection and robust error handling for calendar operations.

## Complexity Score: 7/10
**Medium-High Complexity** - Combines multiple complex domains: timezone mathematics, database operations, fantasy narrative generation, and calendar protocol standards. High complexity from timezone edge cases (DST transitions, leap years), real-time voting coordination, calendar format compliance, and maintaining fantasy immersion while providing practical functionality. The dual nature (fantasy + real-world utility) adds architectural complexity.
