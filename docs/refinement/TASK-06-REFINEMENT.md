# Task 6 Refinement: Tab Completion Implementation

## Change Statement
Add intelligent shell tab completion to myMCP-cli that provides context-aware command suggestions by integrating a new `/api/context/completions` endpoint in the engine. The completion system will suggest different commands based on current game state (available spells, NPCs, quest items) and command context (root commands vs. subcommands). Implementation requires adding a completion API route to the engine, integrating bash/zsh completion scripts in the CLI, and providing user setup instructions.

## Testability Statement
Highly testable with three validation layers: (1) Unit tests for the engine completion API endpoint using supertest to verify correct suggestions for different contexts and partial inputs, (2) Integration tests for CLI completion script generation and API communication, (3) Manual shell testing to verify actual tab completion behavior in bash/zsh environments. Performance testing needed for large suggestion sets, and edge case testing for offline/API failure scenarios.

## Build/Config Concerns
**Low-Medium Risk**: Requires adding new npm dependency (`commander-completion` or similar), new API endpoint in engine (straightforward), and shell completion script generation. Main risks: (1) Cross-platform shell compatibility (bash vs zsh vs PowerShell), (2) User setup complexity requiring manual shell configuration, (3) CLI package.json updates and potential dependency conflicts. No major build pipeline changes needed, but requires documentation for user completion setup.

## Complexity Score: 6/10
**Moderate Complexity** - Well-defined scope with clear implementation path, but involves multiple integration points (CLI, engine API, shell environments). Shell completion setup adds user experience complexity and cross-platform considerations. Requires careful API design for context-aware suggestions and robust error handling for offline scenarios.
