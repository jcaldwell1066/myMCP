# Task 14 Refinement: MCP Server with Protocol Support

## Change Statement
Implement the myMCP-mcpserver component handling stdio communication and translating between MCP (Model Context Protocol) and the myMCP engine API, completing the 5-part architecture. The server enables integration with Claude and other MCP-compatible systems by providing standardized protocol communication, resource discovery, tool execution capabilities, and seamless bridge between external MCP clients and internal game state management. Implementation includes MCP protocol handlers, stdio message parsing, API translation layer, and resource management.

## Testability Statement
Protocol-focused testing approach: (1) Unit tests for MCP message parsing and protocol compliance, (2) Integration tests for stdio communication and API translation accuracy, (3) Protocol conformance testing against MCP specification, (4) End-to-end testing with actual Claude integration, (5) Error handling testing for malformed messages and connection failures. Manual testing required for real-world MCP client compatibility and message flow validation.

## Build/Config Concerns
**Medium Risk**: Requires MCP protocol implementation, stdio handling, message parsing libraries, and external system integration. Main risks: (1) Protocol version compatibility and evolution, (2) Stdio communication reliability and error handling, (3) Message translation accuracy between protocols, (4) Resource management for concurrent MCP sessions, (5) External dependency on MCP ecosystem stability. Requires careful protocol implementation and robust error handling.

## Complexity Score: 8/10
**High Complexity** - Complex protocol implementation requiring deep understanding of MCP specifications, stdio communication patterns, and API translation layers. High complexity from real-time protocol handling, message parsing accuracy, external system integration, and maintaining protocol compliance. The challenge of bridging different communication paradigms (stdio vs HTTP) while preserving game state integrity adds significant architectural complexity.
