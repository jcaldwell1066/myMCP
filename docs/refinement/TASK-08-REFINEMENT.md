# Task 8 Refinement: Fantasy Artifact Theme Pack with Skinnable Assets

## Change Statement
Create a comprehensive theme system with fantasy artifacts as the first theme pack, including ASCII art assets (artifacts, characters, environments), LLM prompt templates for narrative generation, CLI theming system with color schemes, and shared narrative elements. Implement a ThemeManager class for asset loading/caching, a ThemeService for LLM integration, and a skinnable architecture allowing future theme packs. The system provides visual enhancement through ASCII art display, narrative consistency via prompt templates, and theme switching capabilities across CLI and engine components.

## Testability Statement
Multi-layered testing approach: (1) Asset validation tests for ASCII art existence and rendering quality, (2) Unit tests for ThemeManager and ThemeService classes with mocked LLM responses, (3) Integration tests for CLI theme commands and API endpoints, (4) Cross-component testing ensuring theme consistency between CLI and engine, (5) Skinning capability tests with minimal test theme to verify architecture flexibility. Manual testing required for visual asset quality and narrative coherence across different theme contexts.

## Build/Config Concerns
**Low-Medium Risk**: Requires new shared directory structure, file system dependencies for asset loading, and theme discovery mechanisms. Main risks: (1) File path resolution issues across different environments, (2) Asset loading performance with large ASCII art files, (3) Theme metadata validation and compatibility checking, (4) Memory usage from ASCII art caching. Minimal dependencies added but requires careful file organization and cross-platform path handling.

## Complexity Score: 5/10
**Medium Complexity** - Well-defined scope with clear asset structure and straightforward implementation pattern. Complexity comes from file system operations, cross-component integration, and ensuring consistent theming across CLI/engine. The skinnable architecture requires thoughtful design but follows established patterns. Most challenging aspects are asset management, caching strategy, and ensuring theme switching works seamlessly across all components.
