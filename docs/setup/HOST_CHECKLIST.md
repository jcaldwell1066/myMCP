  cd packages/slack-integration
  npm run dev
  ```
- [ ] Verify bot online in Slack
- [ ] Post welcome message in `#mymcp-training`
- [ ] Share Redis URL securely with team

### Team Member Support
- [ ] Help team members with setup issues
- [ ] Verify everyone can:
  - [ ] Clone repository
  - [ ] Run setup script
  - [ ] Start engine
  - [ ] See health check

## During Training

### Introduction (10 min)
- [ ] Explain architecture diagram
- [ ] Show how events flow through Redis
- [ ] Demo Slack commands
- [ ] Show dashboard channel

### Guided Activities
- [ ] Everyone starts same quest together
- [ ] Use breakout rooms for pair debugging
- [ ] Monitor `#mymcp-dashboard` for activity
- [ ] Encourage Slack interactions

### Troubleshooting Ready
- [ ] Have Redis CLI ready for debugging
- [ ] Monitor Slack integration logs
- [ ] Keep backup Redis instance ready
- [ ] Have ngrok installed as backup

## After Training

- [ ] Export Slack conversation
- [ ] Save dashboard screenshots
- [ ] Collect feedback
- [ ] Share recording/materials
- [ ] Clean up Redis (if desired)

## Emergency Contacts

During training, have ready:
- Redis Cloud status page
- Slack API status
- Your backup Redis URL
- Tech support contact

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check Redis
redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL ping

# Check who's connected
redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL smembers game:players

# Monitor events
redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL monitor

# Restart Slack integration
cd packages/slack-integration
npm run dev

# Emergency reset player
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/actions/player-name \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"RESET","payload":{},"playerId":"player-name"}'
```

## Backup Plans

### If Redis Cloud is down:
1. Switch to local Redis + ngrok
2. Have Docker ready: `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine`
3. Use ngrok: `ngrok tcp 6379`

### If Slack is down:
1. Use terminal-only mode
2. Share screens for coordination
3. Use Discord as backup

### If someone can't connect:
1. Pair them with working teammate
2. Use screen share
3. Have them watch and participate via Slack

## Success Metrics

Training is successful when:
- [ ] All 6 members connected to shared Redis
- [ ] Everyone completed at least one quest
- [ ] Slack dashboard shows real-time updates
- [ ] Team successfully coordinated via Slack
- [ ] Technical concepts understood

Good luck with your training! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
