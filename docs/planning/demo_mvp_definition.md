# Demo MVP Definition
**Task 1.4 - Minimum Viable Product Requirements**  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview
Precise definition of the minimum viable product (MVP) for each component required to deliver a successful lunch and learn demonstration that saves our project from enterprise scope creep.

## Core Demo Objective

### The 30-Second Wow Factor
**Primary Goal**: Demonstrate "same state, multiple interfaces, real conversation flow"  
**Success Metric**: Enterprise audience says "That's actually pretty cool" instead of "Why did this take 15 days?"

### Demo Flow (Refined)
```
1. [Web Interface] "Hey bot, what quests are available?"
   → Bot: "I see the Council of Three Realms needs your help with scheduling!"

2. [CLI] ./mycli start-quest "Global Meeting"  
   → "Quest started! You must gather 2 allies from distant kingdoms."

3. [Web Interface] Shows quest interface with timezone map
   → User selects allies from different timezones

4. [CLI] ./mycli check-progress
   → "Allies found: Eastern Kingdom (GMT+8), Western Realm (GMT-5)"

5. [Web Interface] Shows optimal meeting times
   → "Perfect! 2pm your time works for everyone."

6. [CLI] ./mycli complete-quest
   → "Quest completed! +50 gold earned. The realm is grateful!"

7. [Web Interface] Shows updated score and unlocked achievements
```

**Demo Duration**: 30-45 seconds  
**Key Message**: Real timezone coordination skill + fantasy engagement + technical innovation

## Component MVP Requirements

### 1. myMCP-engine (CRITICAL - Foundation)

  PUT /api/state/player → Update player data
  POST /api/quests/start → Begin quest
  POST /api/quests/action → Quest actions
  GET /api/quests/progress → Quest status
  ```
- **Simple game state structure**:
  ```typescript
  {
    player: { name, score, level, currentQuest },
    quests: { available, active, completed },
    session: { turnCount, startTime }
  }
  ```

#### Nice to Have (If Time Permits)

- **Simple dashboard** showing:
  - Current system status
  - Active sessions
  - Quest completion statistics
  - Recent API calls log
- **Manual state manipulation** for demo recovery
- **System health monitoring** basic view

#### Implementation Priority
**Phase 4** - Only if Phase 1-3 complete early
**Demo Value**: Impressive technical showcase but not essential

#### MVP Success Criteria (If Built)
- ✅ Shows real system metrics
- ✅ Can manually reset demo state
- ✅ Provides debugging visibility

---

### 5. myMCP-mcpserver (DEFERRED - Technical Innovation)

#### Must Have Features (If Implemented)
- **Basic MCP protocol implementation**
- **stdio communication** with Claude integration
- **Bridge to myMCP-engine API**
- **Simple tool exposure** (get state, execute quest actions)

#### Implementation Priority
**Phase 4** - Only if Phase 1-3 complete early

## Quest Implementation MVP

### Global Meeting Quest (MUST HAVE)
**Minimum Implementation**:
- **Ally selection**: Present 3 predefined allies in different timezones
- **Timezone calculation**: Simple algorithm to find optimal meeting time
- **UI integration**: Both CLI and Web can complete quest
- **Success state**: Quest marked complete, score updated

**Hard-coded Data for MVP**:
```typescript
const allies = [
  { name: "Eastern Kingdom", timezone: "GMT+8", available: "9am-5pm" },
  { name: "Western Realm", timezone: "GMT-5", available: "8am-6pm" },
  { name: "Northern Lands", timezone: "GMT+1", available: "7am-4pm" }
];
```

### Other Quests (DEFERRED)

- **Reset capability**: Quick way to restore demo state
- **Error recovery**: Clear path if something goes wrong
- **Timing flexibility**: Can extend or compress based on audience interest

## Risk Mitigation for MVP

### High-Risk Elements
1. **Real-time synchronization**: CLI/Web state sync
2. **Quest completion logic**: Complex state transitions
3. **Network reliability**: API calls failing during demo

### MVP Risk Mitigation

2. **Hard-coded quest logic**: Minimal state transitions
3. **Local-only demo**: No external API dependencies

### Fallback Positions
1. **CLI-only demo**: If Web interface has issues
2. **Pre-recorded simulation**: If live demo fails
3. **Static screenshots**: If all technology fails
