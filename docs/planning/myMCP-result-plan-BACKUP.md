# myMCP RESCUE Project Plan - BACKUP

**Generated**: June 10, 2025  
**Project Root**: `/mnt/c/Users/JefferyCaldwell/myMCP`  
**TaskMaster Location**: `.taskmaster/` folder in project root

## Project Context

### The Problem
- Fictional software company lunch and learn demo project
- **Original scope**: Few hours of vibe coding for dev staff fun + quality/stability reassurance  
- **Current reality**: Virtual enterprise boondoggle with 15 full dev days remaining
- **Issue**: Scope creep + endless review cycles killing forward momentum
- **Solution**: Breakaway group to save the lunch and learn

### The Architecture Decision
- **Stack**: Node.js/TypeScript across all components (chosen for speed)
- **Components**: 5-part system
  1. `myMCP-cli` - Command line interface with tab completion
  2. `myMCP-engine` - Game state management with ~24 states + transition rules  
  3. `myMCP-webapp` - React frontend with chat + swimlane panels
  4. `myMCP-mcpserver` - MCP protocol server (stdio communication)
  5. `myMCP-admin` - System monitoring dashboard

### The Quest Vision
**Theme**: Classic fantasy (but skinable)

1. **Quest 1: Global Meeting** ("Council of Three Realms")
   - Real skill: Coordinate meeting across timezones with 2 others
   - Fantasy wrapper: Gathering allies from distant kingdoms

2. **Quest 2: Server Health Adventure** ("Dungeon Keeper's Vigil") 
   - Real skill: Learn server monitoring via turn-based interface
   - Fantasy wrapper: Monitor ancient servers in the Mountain of Processing

3. **Quest 3: HMAC Security** ("Cryptomancer's Seal")
   - Real skill: Mathematical HMAC implementation for message integrity
   - Fantasy wrapper: Forge magical seals using cryptographic spells

### Demo Flow (30 seconds)
1. Web: "Hey bot, what's my current score?" → "You have 0 points"
2. CLI: `./mycli set-score 100` → "Score updated" 
3. Web: "What's my score now?" → "You have 100 points"
4. CLI: `./mycli chat "give me a quest"` → Bot responds with quest
5. Web: Continue quest interaction seamlessly

**Key Message**: Same state, multiple interfaces, real conversation flow

## TaskMaster Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 2-5)
**Deliverable**: Working CLI talking to game engine

- **Task 2**: Set up Node.js project structure for 5 components
- **Task 3**: Create basic myMCP-cli with commander.js (hard-coded responses)
- **Task 4**: Build myMCP-engine with Express.js API for state management  
- **Task 5**: Connect CLI to engine API (replace hard-coded with HTTP calls)

### Phase 2: Core Features (Tasks 6-8)
**Deliverable**: Rich, immersive game experience  

- **Task 6**: Implement tab completion in CLI (context-aware suggestions)
- **Task 7**: Integrate LLM API for dynamic narrative generation in engine
- **Task 8**: Create fantasy artifact theme pack (ASCII art, prompts, skinnable)

### Phase 3: Quest Implementation (Tasks 9-11)
**Deliverable**: Three working quests with real-world skills

- **Task 9**: Implement Quest 1: Global Meeting (timezone coordination)
- **Task 10**: Implement Quest 2: Server Health Adventure (monitoring interface)
- **Task 11**: Implement Quest 3: HMAC Security (cryptographic education)

### Phase 4: Interface Components (Tasks 12-14)
**Deliverable**: Complete 5-component architecture

- **Task 12**: Build myMCP-webapp React frontend with chat interface
- **Task 13**: Create myMCP-admin dashboard for system monitoring  
- **Task 14**: Implement myMCP-mcpserver with MCP protocol support

### Phase 5: Integration & Demo (Tasks 15-16) 
**Deliverable**: Lunch and learn ready presentation

- **Task 15**: Conduct full system integration testing across all components
- **Task 16**: Prepare demo script and final polish for presentation

## Technical Details

### Key Features
- **Tab Completion**: `cast <TAB>` shows available spells based on game state
- **LLM Integration**: Context-aware narrative that varies with state + randomness
- **Shared State**: CLI and web both hit same engine API for consistency
- **Admin Interface**: Real-time dashboards, logs, manual state manipulation
- **Artifact Packs**: Themed assets (CLI ASCII art, web panels, prompt templates)

### Engine API Design
```
GET /state → full current state
PUT /state/player → update player state  
POST /transition/start-quest → attempt transition
GET /context/quest → hierarchical quest context
GET /context/completions?prefix=cast → tab completion suggestions
POST /generate/description → LLM narrative generation
```

### State Management (~24 states)
```
Player: idle, chatting, in-quest, completed-quest
Quest: available, active, completed, failed  
Sub-quest: locked, available, active, completed
Inventory: empty, has-item, full
Location: town, forest, cave, shop
NPC: available, busy, questgiver, merchant
Score: novice, apprentice, expert, master
```

### Dependencies Map
- CLI requires Engine (Task 3 → 4)
- Tab completion requires CLI+Engine integration (Task 6 → 5)
- LLM runs parallel to tab completion (Task 7 → 4)  
- Artifact packs require both features (Task 8 → 6,7)
- All quests require artifact packs (Tasks 9,10,11 → 8)
- Web components require engine (Tasks 12,13,14 → 4)
- Integration requires all interfaces (Task 15 → 12,13,14)
- Demo prep requires integration (Task 16 → 15)

## Success Criteria

### Timeline
- **Target**: This summer (avoid 15-day enterprise death spiral)
- **Strategy**: Incremental delivery with fallback positions at each phase
- **Philosophy**: "Something that actually works" over architectural purity

### Fallback Positions
- **Phase 1 complete**: Can demo basic CLI+Engine interaction
- **Phase 2 complete**: Can show rich game mechanics and LLM integration  
- **Phase 3 complete**: Can demonstrate all three educational quests
- **Phase 4 complete**: Full architecture showcase ready
- **Phase 5 complete**: Professional presentation ready

### Key Messages for Enterprise Audience
1. **Practical Skills**: Real timezone coordination, server monitoring, security concepts
2. **Technical Innovation**: MCP protocol, shared state, context-aware interfaces
3. **Rapid Delivery**: Working system in summer vs 15-day bureaucratic timeline
4. **Extensible Design**: Skinable themes, modular architecture for future growth

## Task Status (as of creation)
- **Total Tasks**: 16 main tasks + 4 subtasks
- **Current Status**: All pending, ready for execution
- **Next Action**: Begin Task #1 (Organizational Failure Analysis)

---

**CRITICAL**: This is our plan to save the lunch and learn from enterprise scope creep. Focus on "working demo" over "perfect architecture". We can bridge back to enterprise stack after proving the concept works.

**Breakaway Group Status**: ✅ Committed to execution  
**Whistle-blower Risk**: Manageable - we're solving the actual problem  
**Success Probability**: High with incremental delivery strategy
