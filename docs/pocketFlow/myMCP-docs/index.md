# Tutorial: myMCP

myMCP is a **fantasy-themed technical training platform** that transforms real-world technical tasks into engaging quest-based adventures. It uses an *AI-powered game engine* to turn mundane activities like meeting scheduling into epic quests like "Council of Three Realms". The system supports **multiple interfaces** (CLI, Web, Slack) and enables teams to learn technical skills through an immersive multiplayer experience with real-time coordination.
