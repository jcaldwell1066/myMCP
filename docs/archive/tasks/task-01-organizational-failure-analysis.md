# Task 01: Conduct Organizational Failure Analysis

**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: None (starting task)

## Description
Perform a comprehensive review of organizational failures to identify systemic issues and improvement opportunities to rescue the myMCP chatbot project for the upcoming lunch and learn demo.

## Subtasks
1. **Component Dependency Mapping** - Create a dependency map between the 5 myMCP components (cli, engine, webapp, mcpserver, admin) to identify critical path items for the demo
2. **Fantasy Quest Implementation Review** - Assess the current state of the Global Meeting, Server Health, and HMAC Security quests to determine what can be completed for the demo  
3. **Interface Compatibility Analysis** - Evaluate the shared state implementation between CLI and web interfaces to ensure core functionality works across platforms
4. **Demo MVP Definition** - Define the minimum viable product for each component required for a successful lunch and learn demonstration

## Context
This is the foundation task that captures our "hail mary" approach to saving the lunch and learn from enterprise scope creep. We're transitioning from a 15-day boondoggle back to a summer delivery timeline.

## Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of what caused the scope creep
- Validated approach for the 5-component myMCP architecture
- Concrete MVP definition for each component
- Confidence in summer delivery timeline vs enterprise 15-day cycle
