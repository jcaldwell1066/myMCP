# üè∞ Join the Council of Three Realms - Team Demo Participation

## üéØ **The Quest Begins in Less Than 4 Days**

We're about to demonstrate something powerful to the entire team - a system that transforms mundane coordination tasks into engaging collaborative adventures. But just like the **Council of Three Realms** quest, we need representatives from different "kingdoms" to make this demo truly compelling.

**Real talk:** This isn't just a tech demo. It's about showing how we can gamify the coordination challenges we face every day - from scheduling cross-team meetings to managing complex product releases.

## üåü **The Council of Three Realms Quest - Our Perfect Demo**

Our flagship quest **"Council of Three Realms"** is about uniting allies from distant kingdoms for a crucial meeting. Sound familiar? It's exactly what we're doing right now:

- **Fantasy**: *"Coordinate representatives from the Mountain Kingdom, the Coastal Realm, and the Forest Territory for an urgent alliance meeting"*
- **Reality**: **Schedule a cross-functional demo with Quality, Product, Backend, and UI stakeholders**

The quest teaches real skills: timezone coordination, meeting scheduling, stakeholder alignment - skills we use every single day.
